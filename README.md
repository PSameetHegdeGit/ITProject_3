We set up the project by connecting the VirtualBox to mininet and sshing from our respective terminals. We attempted to ping each end point to one another in order to test for reachability. We mainly used the ping and traceroute commands to confirm that the project was functioning properly and set up the default routes.  We came across a few errors here and there but they were mostly problems based on our own network connection. We then transferred the list of commands from our local computers to the mininet virtualbox and after numerous tests we were able to get them to run successfully.

After numerous tests across multiple computers, we have not found any issues or functions that failed to work properly

The problems we faced working on this project were mostly involving setting up mininet on the VM and ssh-ing to the mininet virtual box successfully. Another problem was an error that continued to kick us out immediately after attempting to ssh from the control panel on windows. 

What we learned from this project was how to control routers and hosts using the mininet server on a VM. Personally, what I gained the most knowledge on was the general concept of a virtual machine and the ways we can use it. Before this project, I did not really see the need for a virtual machine, but after completing it, I can now see that it would be useful in todayâ€™s digital age. Especially with the numerous ways hackers and websites might try to damage your device or network. The project also gave important insight on how multiple endpoints are connected to a router.
